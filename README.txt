Hello,

execute 'python warp.py' to mosaic images


# IMPORTANT NOTES

note that this will process all .json files in the current directory

note that json files must specify the center image of the mosaic FIRST!

note that bbb_shelf_params.py uses large images which take approx 3-5 min to process

note that results are saved as .tif and .png

note that I used PIL to save as .tif
